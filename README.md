   - Direct extraction from URL
   - Metadata extraction support
   - Fast and memory efficient

2. **[payload-dumper-go](https://github.com/ssut/payload-dumper-go)** - Go implementation
   - Reliable and well-tested

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/KaluaBilla/payload-dumper-magisk/releases)
